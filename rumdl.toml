# Prettier-Compatible Markdown Configuration
# https://prettier.io/docs/options
#
# This config aligns rumdl with Prettier's markdown formatting choices.
# Use when your project uses Prettier for markdown formatting.
#
# Note: Prettier's default prose-wrap is "preserve" (no line wrapping).
# Line length warnings only apply if you use --prose-wrap always.

[global]
line_length = 80  # Prettier default print width (with --prose-wrap always)

# Headings: ATX-style (# Heading) - Prettier converts setext to ATX
[MD003]
style = "atx"

# Lists: Prettier maintains consistent markers within each list
# It doesn't enforce a global marker style across all lists
[MD004]
style = "consistent"

# Lists: Prettier uses 2-space indentation (tab-width default)
[MD007]
indent = 2

# Ordered lists: Prettier renumbers by default, but allows lazy (all 1.)
# Use "one_or_ordered" to accept either style
[MD029]
style = "one_or_ordered"

# Note: MD046 (code block style) is not configured because Prettier
# preserves both fenced and indented code blocks as-is.

# Emphasis: Prettier normalizes italics to underscores, bold to asterisks
[MD049]
style = "underscore"

[MD050]
style = "asterisk"

# The following rules are enabled by default and align with Prettier:
# - MD010: No hard tabs (Prettier converts to spaces)
# - MD012: No multiple consecutive blank lines
# - MD023: Headings must start at beginning of line
# - MD047: Files end with single newline
